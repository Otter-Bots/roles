# Roles
[WIP] An advanced role management bot whose main purpose is to allow server managers to manage and give roles with ease.

## Contributions
Roles' code is open-sourced to allow the anyone to contribute to its development. You can contribute by submitting a pull request, however, we expect a clear description of what your pull request is about and what feature it adds/what problem it solves. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [Discord Server.](https://discord.com/invite/XtX9wx3qre)

## Selfhosting
You can self-host an instance of Roles, but we will not provide support on how to do so.
